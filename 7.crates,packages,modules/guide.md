# Crate 
a crate can be a library crate or a binary crate
Binary crates are programs you can compile to an executable that you can run, such as a command-line program or a server.

Library crates don’t have a main function, and they don’t compile to an executable. Instead, they define functionality intended to be shared with multiple projects.
